# Flask Application

## Project Description

* [Flask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_(web_framework)) is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.
* This is a final project for IS 601. The objective of this project is to create a flask application. Tutorial that we used to make this project can be [found here](https://hackersandslackers.com/your-first-flask-application).
* **Why Flask?** 
Developing apps in Flask has a much different narrative than when developing in more traditional MVC Frameworks. In the past, the setup of a framework would easily take hours: with the assumption that our app needed all the bells and whistles, it was impossible to get a “Hello world!” off the ground without a full understanding of database configurations, static assets, templates, and other things our app may not even need. This is especially a concern for the Python ecosystem. Few people turn to Python for the sole purpose of building a web app: the vast majority of Python developers are in the field of data analysis without a traditional background in application development. Asking data analysts (who have mostly become accustomed to Jupyter notebooks) to pick up all the fundamentals of web development before even getting started is just unrealistic.
